Used bootstrap for base structure of nav/ search bar, login, check out, product cards, & registration had to adjust some things and add other elements that were not present like the radio buttons for how did you hear about us and quantities in cart along with many more minor details.
     <div class="mb-3 form-check">
        <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="exampleCheck1">
        <label class="form-check-label" for="exampleCheck1"> Yes I Would Like Receive Promotional Emails/Texts By
          Clicking Subscribe ' I Accept <a href="">Privacy Policy</a> </label>
      </div>
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"> Create Account</button>
    </form>

  
  
Bootstrap was a huge help and helped me understand html alot better because even though it gave format I had to take things and combine them in places boot strap did not have in the html or remove unwanted elements 
manipulated photo size creating multiple copies for American flag footer on each page.
Although bootstrap was good for initial structure it was a nightmare when working to validate all my pages i found that all the codes i got from there had serious errors in them and because html is forgiving it allowed the webpages to still work properly. Even though it added more work it helped me understand html on a different level and was a great stepping stone.
